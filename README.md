## Accepting Death

This was meant to be a simple project to help teach a friend Python by getting him to convert a simple bash script into a robust Python script.

Unfortunately, since Nintendo has killed the NintendoZone servers this project is basically dead. I'll be leaving this up for now in case any Linux users have a user for it.
